# Effective Project Management with Agile Methodology

---
# Agenda
- Software Development Life Cycle
- Agile
- Scrum

---
# The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- Defines is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares.
- Think of it as how to manage software product

---
![SDLC stages ](/images//sdlc_stages.jpg)  

---

# Stages
- Planning
- Defining Requirements
    - Document SRS Software Requirement Specification
- Designing
    - Designing and architecture, Design Document Specification
- Building
    - Programming code
- Testing
    - Testing product built
- Deploying to Market and Maintenance 
---
# The Software Development Life Cycle Models
- Waterfall Model
- RAD Model
- Spiral Model
- V model
- Incremental Model
- Agile Model
- Iterative Model
- Big-Bang Model
 etc

---
# Traditional Project Management
- Waterfall
    - SDLC phases are executed sequentially
    - Outcome from one phase acts as input for the next phase

---

---
# Problem with Traditional Approach
- Cannot accommodate changing requirements.
- No working software is produced until late during the life cycle.
- Not a good model for complex and object-oriented projects.
- Poor model for long and ongoing projects.
- You can not adjust scope without ending the project

etc

--- 
# The Need for Agile
Agile is based on the adaptive software development methods

- Changing requirements
- Faster time to market
- Customer Centric. Customer is always right ðŸ˜‚
- Reduced risk
- Improved collaboration
- Continuous feedback
- Transparency
etc

# Agile Manifesto

---
# Agile Principles
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

1. Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

1. Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.

1. Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.

---
1. Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.

1. The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.

1. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

1. Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
---
1. Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.

1. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.

1. The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.

1. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.

# Agile Frameworks
- Scrum
- Kanban
- Extreme Programming(XP)
- Lean Software Development
etc

---
# SCRUM
---
# Scrum Framework
- Scrum is structured approach that uses an iterative, incremental approach
    - Roles
    - Events
    - Artifacts
- Pillars -> Transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

---
# Scrum Team
- Scrum Master
    - Unblocks
    - Ensuring that all Scrum events take place

- One product owner
    - Develop and communicate product goal
    - Unblocks
    - Helps devs understand and select trade-offs
- Developers
    - Meeting defition of Done
    - responsible for the sizing stories

---
# Scrum Events
- The Sprint
- Sprint Planing
- Daily Scrum/Standup
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

---
# Scrum Artifacts
- Product Backlog 
    - A list of what is needed to build/improve the product
    - Product is a vehicle to deliver value.
- Sprint Backlog
    - Sprint Goal(Why), product backlog items for the sprint, actionable plan for increment
- Increment
    - Defines Done
    - Defination of Done is acceptance criteria
    - If item is not done, returns to product backlog
